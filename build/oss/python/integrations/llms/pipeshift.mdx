title: Pipeshift
---

이 문서는 LangChain을 사용하여 Pipeshift completion model(LLM)을 시작하는 데 도움을 드립니다. `Pipeshift` 기능 및 구성 옵션에 대한 자세한 문서는 [API reference](https://dashboard.pipeshift.com/docs)를 참조하세요.

## Overview

### Integration details

| Class | Package | Local | Serializable | [JS support](https://js.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/pipeshift) | Downloads | Version |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [Pipeshift](https://dashboard.pipeshift.com/docs) | [langchain-pipeshift](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-pipeshift/) | ❌ | - | ❌ | ![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dm/langchain-pipeshift?style=flat-square&label=%20) | ![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/langchain-pipeshift?style=flat-square&label=%20) |

## Setup

Pipeshift model에 액세스하려면 Pipeshift 계정을 생성하고 API key를 받은 다음 `langchain-pipeshift` integration package를 설치해야 합니다.

### Credentials

[Pipeshift](https://dashboard.pipeshift.com)로 이동하여 Pipeshift에 가입하고 API key를 생성하세요. 완료한 후 PIPESHIFT_API_KEY environment variable을 설정하세요:

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.getenv("PIPESHIFT_API_KEY"):
    os.environ["PIPESHIFT_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your Pipeshift API key: ")
```

model 호출에 대한 자동 추적을 원하시면 아래 주석을 해제하여 [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key를 설정할 수도 있습니다:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
```

### Installation

LangChain Pipeshift integration은 `langchain-pipeshift` package에 있습니다:

```python
pip install -qU langchain-pipeshift
```

```output
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

## Instantiation

이제 model object를 인스턴스화하고 chat completion을 생성할 수 있습니다:

```python
from langchain_pipeshift import Pipeshift

llm = Pipeshift(
    model="meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct",
    temperature=0,
    max_tokens=512,
)
```

## Invocation

```python
input_text = "Pipeshift is an AI company that "

completion = llm.invoke(input_text)
completion
```

```output
