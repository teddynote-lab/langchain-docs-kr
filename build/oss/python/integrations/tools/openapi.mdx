title: OpenAPI Toolkit
---

임의의 API를 사용하는 agent를 구성할 수 있으며, 여기서는 `OpenAPI`/`Swagger` 사양을 준수하는 API를 다룹니다.

```python
# NOTE: In this example. We must set `allow_dangerous_request=True` to enable the OpenAPI Agent to automatically use the Request Tool.
# This can be dangerous for calling unwanted requests. Please make sure your custom OpenAPI spec (yaml) is safe.
ALLOW_DANGEROUS_REQUEST = True
```

## 1번째 예제: hierarchical planning agent

이 예제에서는 로봇 공학에서 일반적이며 최근 LLM X 로봇 공학 연구에서 등장하는 hierarchical planning이라는 접근 방식을 살펴보겠습니다. 이는 대규모 API 사양 작업을 시작하고 API에 대해 여러 단계가 필요한 사용자 쿼리를 지원하는 데 유용한 접근 방식임을 알 수 있습니다.

아이디어는 간단합니다: 긴 시퀀스 동작에 걸쳐 일관된 agent 동작을 얻고 토큰을 절약하기 위해 관심사를 분리합니다. "planner"는 호출할 endpoint를 담당하고 "controller"는 호출 방법을 담당합니다.

초기 구현에서 planner는 각 endpoint의 이름과 간단한 설명을 컨텍스트에 포함하는 LLM chain입니다. controller는 특정 계획에 대한 endpoint의 문서만으로 인스턴스화되는 LLM agent입니다. 이것을 매우 견고하게 작동시키기 위해서는 아직 할 일이 많습니다 :)

### 시작하기 위해 몇 가지 OpenAPI spec을 수집해 보겠습니다

```python
import os

import yaml
```

여기에서 OpenAPI spec을 얻을 수 있습니다: [APIs-guru/openapi-directory](https://github.com/APIs-guru/openapi-directory)

```python

다소 복잡한 API의 예제 중 하나로 Spotify API를 사용하겠습니다. 이를 재현하려면 인증 관련 설정이 필요합니다.

- `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, `REDIRECT_URI` 자격 증명을 얻으려면 [여기](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/authorization/)에 문서화된 대로 Spotify 개발자 콘솔에서 애플리케이션을 설정해야 합니다.
- access token을 얻고 최신 상태로 유지하려면 oauth flow를 구현하거나 `spotipy`를 사용할 수 있습니다. Spotify 자격 증명을 환경 변수 `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID`, `SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET`, `SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI`로 설정한 경우 아래의 헬퍼 함수를 사용할 수 있습니다:

```python
import spotipy.util as util
from langchain_community.utilities.requests import RequestsWrapper


def construct_spotify_auth_headers(raw_spec: dict):
    scopes = list(
        raw_spec["components"]["securitySchemes"]["oauth_2_0"]["flows"][
            "authorizationCode"
        ]["scopes"].keys()
    )
    access_token = util.prompt_for_user_token(scope=",".join(scopes))
    return {"Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}"}


# Get API credentials.
headers = construct_spotify_auth_headers(raw_spotify_api_spec)
requests_wrapper = RequestsWrapper(headers=headers)
```

### 이 spec의 크기는 얼마나 될까요?

```python
endpoints = [
    (route, operation)
    for route, operations in raw_spotify_api_spec["paths"].items()
    for operation in operations
    if operation in ["get", "post"]
]
len(endpoints)
```

```output
63
```

```python
import tiktoken

enc = tiktoken.encoding_for_model("gpt-4")


def count_tokens(s):
    return len(enc.encode(s))


count_tokens(yaml.dump(raw_spotify_api_spec))
```

```output
80326
```

### 몇 가지 예제를 살펴보겠습니다

GPT-4부터 시작합니다. (GPT-3 제품군에 대한 견고성 개선 작업이 진행 중입니다.)

## 2번째 예제: "json explorer" agent

여기 특별히 실용적이지는 않지만 멋진 agent가 있습니다! 이 agent는 2개의 toolkit에 액세스할 수 있습니다. 하나는 json과 상호 작용하는 도구로 구성됩니다: json 객체의 key를 나열하는 도구와 주어진 key의 값을 가져오는 도구입니다. 다른 toolkit은 GET 및 POST 요청을 보내는 `requests` wrapper로 구성됩니다. 이 agent는 언어 모델에 대한 많은 호출을 소비하지만 놀랍도록 괜찮은 작업을 수행합니다.
