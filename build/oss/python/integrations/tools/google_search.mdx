이 노트북은 Google Search component를 사용하는 방법을 다룹니다.

먼저, 적절한 API key와 environment variable을 설정해야 합니다. 설정하려면 Google Cloud credential console([console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials))에서 GOOGLE_API_KEY를 생성하고, Programmable Search Engine([programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create](https://programmablesearchengine.google.com/controlpanel/create))을 사용하여 GOOGLE_CSE_ID를 생성하세요. 다음으로, [여기](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37083058/programmatically-searching-google-in-python-using-custom-search)에서 찾을 수 있는 지침을 따르는 것이 좋습니다.

그런 다음 몇 가지 environment variable을 설정해야 합니다.

```python
pip install -qU  langchain-google-community
```

```python
import os

os.environ["GOOGLE_CSE_ID"] = ""
os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = ""
```

```python
from langchain.tools import Tool
from langchain_google_community import GoogleSearchAPIWrapper

search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()

tool = Tool(
    name="google_search",
    description="Search Google for recent results.",
    func=search.run,
)
```

```python
tool.run("Obama's first name?")
```

```output

```

## 결과 개수

`k` parameter를 사용하여 결과 개수를 설정할 수 있습니다

```python
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper(k=1)

tool = Tool(
    name="I'm Feeling Lucky",
    description="Search Google and return the first result.",
    func=search.run,
)
```

```python
tool.run("python")
```

```output
'The official home of the Python Programming Language.'
```

'The official home of the Python Programming Language.'

## Metadata 결과

GoogleSearch를 통해 query를 실행하고 snippet, title, link metadata를 반환합니다.

- Snippet: 결과의 설명입니다.
- Title: 결과의 제목입니다.
- Link: 결과의 링크입니다.

```python
search = GoogleSearchAPIWrapper()


def top5_results(query):
    return search.results(query, 5)


tool = Tool(
    name="Google Search Snippets",
    description="Search Google for recent results.",
    func=top5_results,
)
```

```python

```
