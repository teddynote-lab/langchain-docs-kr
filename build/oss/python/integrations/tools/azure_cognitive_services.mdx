title: Azure Cognitive Services Toolkit
---

이 toolkit은 `Azure Cognitive Services API`와 상호작용하여 일부 multimodal 기능을 구현하는 데 사용됩니다.

현재 이 toolkit에는 4개의 tool이 포함되어 있습니다:

- AzureCogsImageAnalysisTool: 이미지에서 caption, object, tag 및 text를 추출하는 데 사용됩니다. (참고: 이 tool은 `azure-ai-vision` package에 대한 의존성으로 인해 Mac OS에서는 아직 사용할 수 없으며, 현재 Windows와 Linux에서만 지원됩니다.)
- AzureCogsFormRecognizerTool: 문서에서 text, table 및 key-value pair를 추출하는 데 사용됩니다.
- AzureCogsSpeech2TextTool: 음성을 text로 변환하는 데 사용됩니다.
- AzureCogsText2SpeechTool: text를 음성으로 합성하는 데 사용됩니다.
- AzureCogsTextAnalyticsHealthTool: 의료 entity를 추출하는 데 사용됩니다.

먼저 Azure 계정을 설정하고 Cognitive Services resource를 생성해야 합니다. resource를 생성하려면 [여기](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows)의 지침을 따르세요.

그런 다음 resource의 endpoint, key 및 region을 가져와서 환경 변수로 설정해야 합니다. 이들은 resource의 "Keys and Endpoint" 페이지에서 찾을 수 있습니다.

```python
pip install -qU  azure-ai-formrecognizer > /dev/null
pip install -qU  azure-cognitiveservices-speech > /dev/null
pip install -qU  azure-ai-textanalytics > /dev/null

# For Windows/Linux
pip install -qU  azure-ai-vision > /dev/null
```

```python
pip install -qU langchain-community
```

```python
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "sk-"
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_KEY"] = ""
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_ENDPOINT"] = ""
os.environ["AZURE_COGS_REGION"] = ""
```

## Toolkit 생성하기

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import AzureCognitiveServicesToolkit

toolkit = AzureCognitiveServicesToolkit()
```

```python
[tool.name for tool in toolkit.get_tools()]
```

```output
['Azure Cognitive Services Image Analysis',
 'Azure Cognitive Services Form Recognizer',
 'Azure Cognitive Services Speech2Text',
 'Azure Cognitive Services Text2Speech']
```

## Agent 내에서 사용하기

```python
from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```

```python
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=toolkit.get_tools(),
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.STRUCTURED_CHAT_ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True,
)
```

```python
agent.run(
    "What can I make with these ingredients?"
    "https://images.openai.com/blob/9ad5a2ab-041f-475f-ad6a-b51899c50182/ingredients.png"
)
```

```output

}
\`\`\`


Observation: Caption: a group of eggs and flour in bowls
Objects: Egg, Egg, Food

}
\`\`\`

```

```output
'You can make pancakes, omelettes, or quiches with these ingredients!'
```

```python
audio_file = agent.run("Tell me a joke and read it out for me.")

another brother who is status post coronary artery bypass grafting. The patient had a stress echocardiogram done on July , 2001 ,
which showed no wall motion abnormalities , but this was a difficult study due to body habitus. The patient went for six minutes with
minimal ST depressions in the anterior lateral leads , thought due to fatigue and wrist pain , his anginal equivalent. Due to the patient's
