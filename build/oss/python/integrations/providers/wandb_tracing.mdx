title: Weights & Biases tracing
---

LangChain을 추적하는 두 가지 권장 방법이 있습니다:

1. `LANGCHAIN_WANDB_TRACING` environment variable을 "true"로 설정합니다.
1. tracing_enabled() context manager를 사용하여 특정 코드 블록을 추적합니다.

**참고** environment variable이 설정되면 context manager 내부에 있는지 여부와 관계없이 모든 코드가 추적됩니다.

```python
import os

from langchain_community.callbacks import wandb_tracing_enabled

os.environ["LANGCHAIN_WANDB_TRACING"] = "true"

# wandb documentation to configure wandb using env variables
# https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/advanced/environment-variables
# here we are configuring the wandb project name
os.environ["WANDB_PROJECT"] = "langchain-tracing"

from langchain.agents import AgentType, initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain_openai import OpenAI
```

```python
# Agent run with tracing. Ensure that OPENAI_API_KEY is set appropriately to run this example.

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)
tools = load_tools(["llm-math"], llm=llm)
```

```python
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True
)

agent.run("What is 2 raised to .123243 power?")  # this should be traced
# A url with for the trace sesion like the following should print in your console:
# https://wandb.ai/<wandb_entity>/<wandb_project>/runs/<run_id>
# The url can be used to view the trace session in wandb.
```

```python
# Now, we unset the environment variable and use a context manager.
if "LANGCHAIN_WANDB_TRACING" in os.environ:
    del os.environ["LANGCHAIN_WANDB_TRACING"]

# enable tracing using a context manager
with wandb_tracing_enabled():
    agent.run("What is 5 raised to .123243 power?")  # this should be traced

agent.run("What is 2 raised to .123243 power?")  # this should not be traced
```
