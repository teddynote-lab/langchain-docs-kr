> [Linkup](https://www.linkup.so/)은 LLM을 웹 및 Linkup Premium Partner 소스에 연결하는 API를 제공합니다.

이 문서는 LinkupSearchRetriever [retriever](/oss/python/langchain/retrieval/)를 시작하는 데 도움이 됩니다. LinkupSearchRetriever의 모든 기능과 구성에 대한 자세한 문서는 [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/linkup/retrievers/linkup_langchain.search_retriever.LinkupSearchRetriever.html)를 참조하세요.

### Integration 세부 정보

| Retriever | Source | Package |
| :--- | :--- | :---: |
[LinkupSearchRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/linkup/retrievers/linkup_langchain.search_retriever.LinkupSearchRetriever.html) | Web and partner sources | langchain-linkup |

## Setup

Linkup provider를 사용하려면 유효한 API key가 필요하며, [여기](https://app.linkup.so/sign-up)에서 가입하여 찾을 수 있습니다. 그런 다음 `LINKUP_API_KEY` environment variable로 설정할 수 있습니다. 아래 chain 예제의 경우 `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable로 OpenAI API key도 설정해야 하며, 여기에서도 설정할 수 있습니다:

```python
# import os
# os.environ["LINKUP_API_KEY"] = ""  # Fill with your API key
# os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = ""  # Fill with your API key
```

개별 쿼리에서 자동화된 tracing을 원하는 경우, 아래 주석을 해제하여 [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key를 설정할 수도 있습니다:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
```

### Installation

이 retriever는 `langchain-linkup` package에 있습니다:

```python
pip install -qU langchain-linkup
```

## Instantiation

이제 retriever를 인스턴스화할 수 있습니다:

```python
from langchain_linkup import LinkupSearchRetriever

retriever = LinkupSearchRetriever(
    depth="deep",  # "standard" or "deep"
    linkup_api_key=None,  # API key can be passed here or set as the LINKUP_API_KEY environment variable
)
```

## Usage

```python
query = "Who won the latest US presidential elections?"

retriever.invoke(query)
```
