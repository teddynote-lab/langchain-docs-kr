>[Kai Data API](https://www.kay.ai/)는 RAG를 위해 구축되었습니다 🕵️ 우리는 세계 최대 규모의 데이터셋을 고품질 embedding으로 큐레이션하여 AI agent가 즉시 context를 검색할 수 있도록 합니다. 최신 모델, 빠른 검색, 그리고 인프라 관리 불필요.

이 notebook은 [Kay](https://kay.ai/)에서 지원하는 데이터셋을 검색하는 방법을 보여줍니다. 현재 미국 기업의 `SEC Filings`와 `Press Releases`를 검색할 수 있습니다. 최신 데이터 업데이트는 [kay.ai](https://kay.ai)를 방문하세요. 질문이 있으시면 [discord](https://discord.gg/hAnE4e5T6M)에 참여하거나 [트위터로 문의](https://twitter.com/vishalrohra_)해주세요.

## Installation

먼저 [`kay` package](https://pypi.org/project/kay/)를 설치합니다.

```python
!pip install kay
```

API key도 필요합니다: [https://kay.ai](https://kay.ai)에서 무료로 받을 수 있습니다. API key를 받은 후에는 환경 변수 `KAY_API_KEY`로 설정해야 합니다.

`KayAiRetriever`는 다음 인자를 받는 정적 `.create()` factory method를 가지고 있습니다:

* `dataset_id: string` 필수 -- Kay dataset id입니다. 이는 회사, 사람 또는 장소와 같은 특정 entity에 대한 데이터 모음입니다. 예를 들어 `"company"`를 시도해보세요.
* `data_type: List[string]` 선택 -- 이는 'SEC Filings', 'Press Releases' 또는 'Reports'와 같이 출처나 형식에 따른 dataset 내의 카테고리입니다. 예를 들어 "company" dataset에서 ["10-K", "10-Q", "PressRelease"]를 시도해보세요. 비워두면 Kay는 모든 타입에서 가장 관련성 높은 context를 검색합니다.
* `num_contexts: int` 선택, 기본값 6 -- `get_relevant_documents()` 호출 시 검색할 document chunk의 수

**Answer**: In 2023, Roku made a strategic partnership with FreeWheel to bring Roku's leading ad tech to FreeWheel customers. This partnership aimed to drive greater interoperability and automation in the advertising-based video on demand (AVOD) space. Key highlights of this collaboration include streamlined integration of Roku's demand application programming interface (dAPI) with FreeWheel's TV platform, allowing for better inventory quality control and improved publisher yield and revenue. Additionally, publishers can now use Roku platform signals to enable advertisers to target audiences and measure campaign performance without relying on cookies. This partnership also involves the use of data clean room technology to enable the activation of additional data sets for better measurement and monetization for publishers and agencies. These partnerships and strategies aim to support Roku's growth in the AVOD market.
