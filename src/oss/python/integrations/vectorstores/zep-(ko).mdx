이 integration을 사용하려면 `pip install -qU langchain-community`로 `langchain-community`를 설치해야 합니다

## 사용법

아래 예제에서는 Zep의 auto-embedding 기능을 사용하여 Zep 서버에서 저지연 embedding 모델을 사용해 문서를 자동으로 embedding합니다.

## 참고

- 이 예제들은 Zep의 async interface를 사용합니다. 메서드 이름에서 `a` 접두사를 제거하여 sync interface를 호출하세요.
- @[`Embeddings`] 인스턴스를 전달하면 Zep은 문서를 자동으로 embedding하는 대신 이를 사용하여 문서를 embedding합니다.
문서 collection을 `isAutoEmbedded === false`로 설정해야 합니다.
- collection을 `isAutoEmbedded === false`로 설정하면 @[`Embeddings`] 인스턴스를 전달해야 합니다.
