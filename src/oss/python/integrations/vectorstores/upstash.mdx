title: Upstash Vector
---

> [Upstash Vector](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/overall/whatisvector)는 vector embedding 작업을 위해 설계된 서버리스 vector 데이터베이스입니다.
>
> vector langchain integration은 [upstash-vector](https://github.com/upstash/vector-py) 패키지를 감싸는 wrapper입니다.
>
> python 패키지는 내부적으로 [vector rest api](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/api/get-started)를 사용합니다.

## Installation

[upstash console](https://console.upstash.com/vector)에서 원하는 차원과 거리 메트릭으로 무료 vector 데이터베이스를 생성하세요.

그런 다음 다음과 같은 방법으로 `UpstashVectorStore` 인스턴스를 생성할 수 있습니다:

- 환경 변수 `UPSTASH_VECTOR_URL`과 `UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN` 제공

- 생성자에 매개변수로 전달

- Upstash Vector `Index` 인스턴스를 생성자에 전달

또한, 주어진 텍스트를 embedding으로 변환하기 위해 @[`Embeddings`] 인스턴스가 필요합니다. 여기서는 예시로 `OpenAIEmbeddings`를 사용합니다

```python
pip install langchain-openai langchain langchain-community upstash-vector
```

```python
import os

from langchain_community.vectorstores.upstash import UpstashVectorStore
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<YOUR_OPENAI_KEY>"
os.environ["UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_URL"] = "<YOUR_UPSTASH_VECTOR_URL>"
os.environ["UPSTASH_VECTOR_REST_TOKEN"] = "<YOUR_UPSTASH_VECTOR_TOKEN>"

# Create an embeddings instance
embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings()

# Create a vector store instance
store = UpstashVectorStore(embedding=embeddings)
```

`UpstashVectorStore`를 생성하는 다른 방법은 [모델을 선택하여 Upstash Vector index를 생성](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/features/embeddingmodels#using-a-model)하고 `embedding=True`를 전달하는 것입니다. 이 구성에서는 문서나 쿼리가 텍스트로 Upstash에 전송되고 그곳에서 embedding됩니다.

```python
store = UpstashVectorStore(embedding=True)
```

이 방법을 시도해보고 싶다면, 위와 같이 `store`의 초기화를 업데이트하고 나머지 튜토리얼을 실행할 수 있습니다.

## Load documents

예제 텍스트 파일을 로드하고 vector embedding으로 변환할 수 있는 청크로 분할합니다.

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import TextLoader
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

loader = TextLoader("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt")
documents = loader.load()
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
docs = text_splitter.split_documents(documents)

docs[:3]
```

```output
[Document(metadata={'source': '../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt'}, page_content='Madam Speaker, Madam Vice President, our First Lady and Second Gentleman. Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Justices of the Supreme Court. My fellow Americans.  \n\nLast year COVID-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again. \n\nTonight, we meet as Democrats Republicans and Independents. But most importantly as Americans. \n\nWith a duty to one another to the American people to the Constitution. \n\nAnd with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny. \n\nSix days ago, Russia’s Vladimir Putin sought to shake the foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways. But he badly miscalculated. \n\nHe thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead he met a wall of strength he never imagined. \n\nHe met the Ukrainian people. \n\nFrom President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, inspires the world.'),
 Document(metadata={'source': '../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt'}, page_content='Groups of citizens blocking tanks with their bodies.

And he thought he could divide us at home. Putin was wrong. We were ready.  Here is what we did.   \n\nWe prepared extensively and carefully. \n\nWe spent months building a coalition of other freedom-loving nations from Europe and the Americas to Asia and Africa to confront Putin. \n\nI spent countless hours unifying our European allies. We shared with the world in advance what we knew Putin was planning and precisely how he would try to falsely justify his aggression.  \n\nWe countered Russia’s lies with truth.   \n\nAnd now that he has acted the free world is holding him accountable. \n\nAlong with twenty-seven members of the European Union including France, Germany, Italy, as well as countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, and many others, even Switzerland.')]

## Inserting documents

vectorstore는 embedding 객체를 사용하여 텍스트 청크를 embedding하고 데이터베이스에 일괄 삽입합니다. 이는 삽입된 vector의 id 배열을 반환합니다.

```python
inserted_vectors = store.add_documents(docs)

inserted_vectors[:5]
```

```output
['247aa3ae-9be9-43e2-98e4-48f94f920749',
 'c4dfc886-0a2d-497c-b2b7-d923a5cb3832',
 '0350761d-ca68-414e-b8db-7eca78cb0d18',
 '902fe5eb-8543-486a-bd5f-79858a7a8af1',
 '28875612-c672-4de4-b40a-3b658c72036a']
```

## Querying

데이터베이스는 vector 또는 텍스트 프롬프트를 사용하여 쿼리할 수 있습니다.
텍스트 프롬프트를 사용하는 경우, 먼저 embedding으로 변환된 후 쿼리됩니다.

`k` 매개변수는 쿼리에서 반환할 결과의 수를 지정합니다.

```python
result = store.similarity_search("technology", k=5)
result
```

## Querying with score

쿼리의 score를 모든 결과에 포함할 수 있습니다.

> 쿼리 요청에서 반환되는 score는 0과 1 사이의 정규화된 값으로, 사용된 유사도 함수에 관계없이 1은 가장 높은 유사도를, 0은 가장 낮은 유사도를 나타냅니다. 자세한 내용은 [문서](https://upstash.com/docs/vector/overall/features#vector-similarity-functions)를 참조하세요.

```python
result = store.similarity_search_with_score("technology", k=5)

for doc, score in result:

## Namespaces

Namespace는 다양한 유형의 문서를 분리하는 데 사용할 수 있습니다. 이는 검색 공간이 줄어들기 때문에 쿼리의 효율성을 높일 수 있습니다. namespace가 제공되지 않으면 기본 namespace가 사용됩니다.

```python
store_books = UpstashVectorStore(embedding=embeddings, namespace="books")
```

```python
store_books.add_texts(

## Getting info about vector database

info 함수를 사용하여 거리 메트릭 차원과 같은 데이터베이스에 대한 정보를 얻을 수 있습니다.

> 삽입이 발생하면 데이터베이스에서 인덱싱이 수행됩니다. 이 작업이 진행되는 동안 새로운 vector는 쿼리할 수 없습니다. `pendingVectorCount`는 현재 인덱싱 중인 vector의 수를 나타냅니다.

```python
store.info()
```

```output
InfoResult(vector_count=49, pending_vector_count=0, index_size=2978163, dimension=1536, similarity_function='COSINE', namespaces={'': NamespaceInfo(vector_count=42, pending_vector_count=0), 'books': NamespaceInfo(vector_count=7, pending_vector_count=0)})
```

## Deleting vectors

Vector는 id로 삭제할 수 있습니다

```python
store.delete(inserted_vectors)
```

## Clearing the vector database

이것은 vector 데이터베이스를 지웁니다

```python
store.delete(delete_all=True)
store_books.delete(delete_all=True)
```
