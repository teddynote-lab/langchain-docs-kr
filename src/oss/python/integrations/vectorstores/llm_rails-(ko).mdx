>[LLMRails](https://www.llmrails.com/)는 GenAI 애플리케이션 구축을 위한 API 플랫폼입니다. LLMRails에서 관리하며 성능과 정확도에 최적화된 문서 인덱싱 및 쿼리를 위한 사용하기 쉬운 API를 제공합니다.
API 사용 방법에 대한 자세한 내용은 [LLMRails API 문서](https://docs.llmrails.com/)를 참조하세요.

이 integration을 사용하려면 `pip install -qU langchain-community`로 `langchain-community`를 설치해야 합니다.

이 노트북은 `LLMRails`의 langchain integration과 관련된 기능을 사용하는 방법을 보여줍니다.
이 카테고리의 다른 많은 integration과 달리, LLMRails는 retrieval augmented generation을 위한 엔드투엔드 관리형 서비스를 제공합니다. 여기에는 다음이 포함됩니다:

1. 문서 파일에서 텍스트를 추출하고 문장으로 청크하는 방법.
2. 자체 embeddings model과 vector store - 각 텍스트 세그먼트는 vector embedding으로 인코딩되어 LLMRails 내부 vector store에 저장됩니다.
3. 쿼리를 자동으로 embedding으로 인코딩하고 가장 관련성 높은 텍스트 세그먼트를 검색하는 쿼리 서비스([Hybrid Search](https://docs.llmrails.com/datastores/search) 지원 포함)

이 모든 기능이 이 LangChain integration에서 지원됩니다.

# Setup

LangChain에서 LLMRails를 사용하려면 LLMRails 계정이 필요합니다. 시작하려면 다음 단계를 따르세요:

1. LLMRails 계정이 없다면 [가입](https://console.llmrails.com/signup)하세요.
2. 다음으로 API에 액세스하기 위한 API key를 생성해야 합니다. corpus 뷰에서 **"API Keys"** 탭을 클릭한 다음 **"Create API Key"** 버튼을 클릭하세요. key에 이름을 지정하세요. "Create key"를 클릭하면 활성 API key가 생성됩니다. 이 key는 기밀로 유지하세요.

LangChain에서 LLMRails를 사용하려면 api_key 값이 필요합니다.
다음 두 가지 방법으로 LangChain에 제공할 수 있습니다:

1. 환경에 다음 두 변수를 포함시킵니다: `LLM_RAILS_API_KEY`, `LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID`.

> 예를 들어, os.environ과 getpass를 사용하여 다음과 같이 이러한 변수를 설정할 수 있습니다:

```python
import os
import getpass

os.environ["LLM_RAILS_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("LLMRails API Key:")
os.environ["LLM_RAILS_DATASTORE_ID"] = getpass.getpass("LLMRails Datastore Id:")
```

1. LLMRails vectorstore 객체를 생성할 때 인수로 제공합니다:

```python
vectorstore = LLMRails(
    api_key=llm_rails_api_key,
    datastore_id=datastore_id
)
```

## 텍스트 추가하기

datastore에 텍스트를 추가하려면 먼저 [Datastores](https://console.llmrails.com/datastores) 페이지로 이동하여 하나를 생성해야 합니다. Create Datastore 버튼을 클릭하고 datastore의 이름과 embedding model을 선택하세요. 그런 다음 새로 생성된 datastore 설정에서 datastore id를 가져오세요.

```python
pip install tika
```

```output

## Similarity search

LLMRails를 사용하는 가장 간단한 시나리오는 similarity search를 수행하는 것입니다.

```python
query = "What do you plan to do about national security?"
found_docs = llm_rails.similarity_search(query, k=5)
```

```python
print(found_docs[0].page_content)
```

```output
6  N A T I O N A L S E C U R I T Y S T R A T E G Y Page 7 

This National Security Strategy lays out our plan to achieve a better future of a free, open, secure, and prosperous world.

Our strategy is rooted in our national interests: to protect the security of the American people; to expand economic prosperity and opportunity; and to realize and defend the democratic values at the heart of the American way of life.

We can do none of this alone and we do not have to.

Most nations around the world define their interests in ways that are compatible with ours.

We will build the strongest and broadest possible coalition of nations that seek to cooperate with each other, while competing with those powers that offer a darker vision and thwarting their efforts to threaten our interests.

Our Enduring Role The need for a strong and purposeful American role in the world has never been greater.

The world is becoming more divided and unstable.

Global increases in inflation since the COVID-19 pandemic began have made life more difficult for many.

The basic laws and principles governing relations among nations, including the United Nations Charter and the protection it affords all states from being invaded by their neighbors or having their borders redrawn by force, are under attack.

The risk of conflict between major powers is increasing.

Democracies and autocracies are engaged in a contest to show which system of governance can best deliver for their people and the world.

Competition to develop and deploy foundational technologies that will transform our security and economy is intensifying.

Global cooperation on shared interests has frayed, even as the need for that cooperation takes on existential importance.

The scale of these changes grows with each passing year, as do the risks of inaction.

Although the international environment has become more contested, the United States remains the world’s leading power.

## 점수를 포함한 Similarity search

때로는 검색을 수행하면서 특정 결과가 얼마나 좋은지 알기 위해 관련성 점수를 얻고 싶을 수 있습니다.

```python
query = "What is your approach to national defense"
found_docs = llm_rails.similarity_search_with_score(
    query,
    k=5,
)
```

```python
document, score = found_docs[0]
print(document.page_content)
print(f"\nScore: {score}")
```

```output
But we will do so as the last resort and only when the objectives and mission are clear and achievable, consistent with our values and laws, alongside non-military tools, and the mission is undertaken with the informed consent of the American people.

Our approach to national defense is described in detail in the 2022 National Defense Strategy.

Our starting premise is that a powerful U.S. military helps advance and safeguard vital U.S. national interests by backstopping diplomacy, confronting aggression, deterring conflict, projecting strength, and protecting the American people and their economic interests.

Amid intensifying competition, the military’s role is to maintain and gain warfighting advantages while limiting those of our competitors.

The military will act urgently to sustain and strengthen deterrence, with the PRC as its pacing challenge.

We will make disciplined choices regarding our national defense and focus our attention on the military’s primary responsibilities: to defend the homeland, and deter attacks and aggression against the United States, our allies and partners, while being prepared to fight and win the Nation’s wars should diplomacy and deterrence fail.

To do so, we will combine our strengths to achieve maximum effect in deterring acts of aggression—an approach we refer to as integrated deterrence (see text box on page 22).

We will operate our military using a campaigning mindset—sequencing logically linked military activities to advance strategy-aligned priorities.

And, we will build a resilient force and defense ecosystem to ensure we can perform these functions for decades to come.

We ended America’s longest war in Afghanistan, and with it an era of major military operations to remake other societies, even as we have maintained the capacity to address terrorist threats to the American people as they emerge.

A combat-credible military is the foundation of deterrence and America’s ability to prevail in conflict.
