## Setup

langchain-gradient는 DigitalOcean Gradient Platform을 사용합니다.

DigitalOcean에서 계정을 생성하고, Gradient Platform에서 `DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY` API key를 획득한 후, `langchain-gradient` integration package를 설치하세요.

### Credentials

[DigitalOcean Login](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/login)으로 이동하세요

1. DigitalOcean Cloud Console에 가입/로그인합니다
2. Gradient Platform으로 이동하여 Serverless Inference로 이동합니다.
3. Create model access key를 클릭하고, 이름을 입력한 후 key를 생성합니다.

완료되면 `DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY` environment variable을 설정하세요:

```python
import getpass
import os

if not os.getenv("DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY"):
    os.environ["DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY"] = getpass.getpass(
        "Enter your DIGITALOCEAN_INFERENCE_KEY API key: "
    )
```

model 호출에 대한 자동 추적을 원하시면 아래 주석을 해제하여 [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key를 설정할 수 있습니다:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
```

### Installation

DigitalOcean Gradient integration은 `langchain-gradient` package에 포함되어 있습니다:

```python
pip install -qU langchain-gradient
```

```output
[notice] A new release of pip is available: 24.0 -> 25.1.1
[notice] To update, run: pip3.12 install --upgrade pip
Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.
```

## Instantiation

이제 model object를 인스턴스화하고 chat completion을 생성할 수 있습니다:

```python
from langchain_gradient import ChatGradient

llm = ChatGradient(
    model="llama3.3-70b-instruct",
    # other params...
)
```

## Invocation

```python
messages = [
    (
        "system",
        "You are a creative storyteller. Continue any story prompt you receive in an engaging and imaginative way.",
    ),
    (
        "human",
        "Once upon a time, in a village at the edge of a mysterious forest, a young girl named Mira found a glowing stone...",
    ),
]
ai_msg = llm.invoke(messages)
ai_msg

```output

The light emanating from it cast eerie shadows on the trees around her, making her feel as though she was standing at the threshold of a secret world.

## Chaining

다음과 같이 model을 prompt template과 연결할 수 있습니다:

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate(
    [
        (
            "system",
            'You are a knowledgeable assistant. Carefully read the provided context and answer the user\'s question. If the answer is present in the context, cite the relevant sentence. If not, reply with "Not found in context."',
        ),
        ("human", "Context: {context}\nQuestion: {question}"),
    ]
)

chain = prompt | llm
chain.invoke(
    {
        "context": (
            "The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris and was completed in 1889. "
            "It was designed by Gustave Eiffel's engineering company. "
            "The tower is one of the most recognizable structures in the world. "
            "The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France to the United States."
        ),
        "question": "Who designed the Eiffel Tower and when was it completed?",
    }
)
```

```output
AIMessage(content='The Eiffel Tower was designed by Gustave Eiffel\'s engineering company and was completed in 1889. (Sentence: "It was designed by Gustave Eiffel\'s engineering company.
