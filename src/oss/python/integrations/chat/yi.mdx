title: ChatYI
---

이 문서는 Yi [chat models](/oss/langchain/models) 시작하기를 도와드립니다. 모든 ChatYi 기능과 구성에 대한 자세한 문서는 [API reference](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/lanchain_community/chat_models/lanchain_community.chat_models.yi.ChatYi.html)를 참조하세요.

[01.AI](https://www.lingyiwanwu.com/en)는 Dr. Kai-Fu Lee가 설립한 AI 2.0의 최전선에 있는 글로벌 기업입니다. 6B에서 수천억 개의 parameter에 이르는 Yi 시리즈를 포함한 최첨단 large language model을 제공합니다. 01.AI는 또한 multimodal model, open API platform, 그리고 Yi-34B/9B/6B 및 Yi-VL과 같은 오픈소스 옵션을 제공합니다.

## Setup

ChatYi model에 접근하려면 01.AI 계정을 생성하고, API key를 발급받고, `langchain_community` integration package를 설치해야 합니다.

### Credentials

[01.AI](https://platform.01.ai)로 이동하여 01.AI에 가입하고 API key를 생성하세요. 완료되면 `YI_API_KEY` environment variable을 설정하세요:

```python
import getpass
import os

if "YI_API_KEY" not in os.environ:
    os.environ["YI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your Yi API key: ")
```

model 호출의 자동 추적을 활성화하려면 [LangSmith](https://docs.smith.langchain.com/) API key를 설정하세요:

```python
os.environ["LANGSMITH_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass("Enter your LangSmith API key: ")
os.environ["LANGSMITH_TRACING"] = "true"
```

### Installation

LangChain __ModuleName__ integration은 `langchain_community` package에 있습니다:

```python
pip install -qU langchain_community
```

## Instantiation

이제 model object를 인스턴스화하고 chat completion을 생성할 수 있습니다:

- TODO: 관련 params로 model instantiation을 업데이트하세요.

```python
from langchain_community.chat_models.yi import ChatYi

llm = ChatYi(
    model="yi-large",
    temperature=0,
    timeout=60,
    yi_api_base="https://api.01.ai/v1/chat/completions",
    # other params...
)
```

## Invocation

```python
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage, SystemMessage

messages = [
    SystemMessage(content="You are an AI assistant specializing in technology trends."),
    HumanMessage(
        content="What are the potential applications of large language models in healthcare?"
    ),
]

ai_msg = llm.invoke(messages)
ai_msg
```

```output
AIMessage(content="Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to significantly impact healthcare by enhancing various aspects of patient care, research, and administrative processes. Here are some potential applications:\n\n1. **Clinical Documentation and Reporting**: LLMs can assist in generating patient reports and documentation by understanding and summarizing clinical notes, making the process more efficient and reducing the administrative burden on healthcare professionals.\n\n2. **Medical Coding and Billing**: These models can help in automating the coding process for medical billing by accurately translating clinical notes into standardized codes, reducing errors and improving billing efficiency.\n\n3. **Clinical Decision Support**: LLMs can analyze patient data and medical literature to provide evidence-based recommendations to healthcare providers, aiding in diagnosis and treatment planning.\n\n4. **Patient Education and Communication**: By simplifying medical jargon, LLMs can help in educating patients about their conditions, treatment options, and preventive care, improving patient engagement and health literacy.\n\n5. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) for EHRs**: LLMs can enhance NLP capabilities in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) systems, enabling better extraction of information from unstructured data, such as clinical notes, to support data-driven decision-making.\n\n6. **Drug Discovery and Development**: LLMs can analyze biomedical literature and clinical trial data to identify new drug candidates, predict drug interactions, and support the development of personalized medicine.\n\n7. **Telemedicine and Virtual Health Assistants**: Integrated into telemedicine platforms, LLMs can provide preliminary assessments and triage, offering patients basic health advice and determining the urgency of their needs, thus optimizing the utilization of healthcare resources.\n\n8. **Research and Literature Review**: LLMs can expedite the process of reviewing medical literature by quickly identifying relevant studies and summarizing findings, accelerating research and evidence-based practice.\n\n9. **Personalized Medicine**: By analyzing a patient's genetic information and medical history, LLMs can help in tailoring treatment plans and medication dosages, contributing to the advancement of personalized medicine.\n\n10. **Quality Improvement and Risk Assessment**: LLMs can analyze healthcare data to identify patterns that may indicate areas for quality improvement or potential risks, such as hospital-acquired infections or adverse drug events.\n\n11. **Mental Health Support**: LLMs can provide mental health support by offering coping strategies, mindfulness exercises, and preliminary assessments, serving as a complement to professional mental health services.\n\n12. **Continuing Medical Education (CME)**: LLMs can personalize CME by recommending educational content based on a healthcare provider's practice area, patient demographics, and emerging medical literature, ensuring that professionals stay updated with the latest advancements.\n\nWhile the applications of LLMs in healthcare are promising, it's crucial to address challenges such as data privacy, model bias, and the need for regulatory approval to ensure that these technologies are implemented safely and ethically.", response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 656, 'prompt_tokens': 40, 'total_tokens': 696}, 'model': 'yi-large'}, id='run-870850bd-e4bf-4265-8730-1736409c0acf-0')
