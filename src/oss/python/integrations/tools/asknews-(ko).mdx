> [AskNews](https://asknews.app)는 단일 자연어 쿼리를 사용하여 최신 글로벌 뉴스(또는 과거 뉴스)를 모든 LLM에 주입합니다. 구체적으로, AskNews는 매일 30만 개 이상의 기사를 번역, 요약, 엔티티 추출 및 hot/cold vector database에 인덱싱하여 풍부하게 만듭니다. AskNews는 이러한 vector database를 저지연 엔드포인트로 제공합니다. AskNews를 쿼리하면 가장 관련성 높은 enrichment(예: 엔티티, 분류, 번역, 요약)를 포함하는 프롬프트 최적화 문자열을 받게 됩니다. 이는 자체 뉴스 RAG를 관리할 필요가 없으며, 뉴스 정보를 LLM에 압축된 방식으로 적절하게 전달하는 방법에 대해 걱정할 필요가 없음을 의미합니다.
> AskNews는 또한 투명성을 중요하게 생각하며, 이것이 바로 수백 개 국가, 13개 언어, 5만 개 소스에 걸쳐 우리의 커버리지가 모니터링되고 다양화되는 이유입니다. 소스 커버리지를 추적하고 싶다면 [투명성 대시보드](https://asknews.app/en/transparency)를 방문할 수 있습니다.

## Setup

이 integration은 `langchain-community` 패키지에 포함되어 있습니다. 또한 `asknews` 패키지 자체도 설치해야 합니다.

```bash
pip install -U langchain-community asknews
```

또한 [AskNews console](https://my.asknews.app)에서 얻을 수 있는 AskNews API 자격 증명을 설정해야 합니다.

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["ASKNEWS_CLIENT_ID"] = getpass.getpass()
os.environ["ASKNEWS_CLIENT_SECRET"] = getpass.getpass()
```

## Usage

여기서는 도구를 개별적으로 사용하는 방법을 보여줍니다.

```python
from langchain_community.tools.asknews import AskNewsSearch

tool = AskNewsSearch(max_results=2)
tool.invoke({"query": "Effect of fed policy on tech sector"})
```

"\n<doc>\n[1]:\ntitle: Market Awaits Comments From Key Fed Official\nsummary: The market is awaiting comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller, but it's not expected to move markets significantly. The recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) report showed slimming inflation figures, leading to a conclusion that inflation is being curbed. This has led to a 'soft landing' narrative, causing bullish sentiment in the stock market, with the Dow, S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Russell 2000 indices near all-time highs. NVIDIA is set to report earnings next week, and despite its 95% year-to-date growth, it remains a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock. The article also mentions upcoming economic data releases, including New and Existing Home Sales, S&P flash PMI Services and Manufacturing, Durable Goods, and Weekly Jobless Claims.\nsource: Yahoo\npublished: May 17 2024 14:53\nOrganization: Nasdaq, Fed, NVIDIA, Zacks\nPerson: Christopher Waller\nEvent: Weekly Jobless Claims\nclassification: Business\nsentiment: 0\n</doc>\n\n<doc>\n[2]:\ntitle: US futures flat as Fed comments cool rate cut optimism\nsummary: US stock index futures remained flat on Thursday evening, following a weak finish on Wall Street, as Federal Reserve officials warned that bets on interest rate cuts were potentially premature. The Fed officials, including Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic, New York Fed President John Williams, and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, stated that the central bank still needed more confidence to cut interest rates, and that the timing of the move remained uncertain. As a result, investors slightly trimmed their expectations for a September rate cut, and the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes fell 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, Reddit surged 11% after announcing a partnership with OpenAI, while Take-Two Interactive and DXC Technology fell after issuing disappointing earnings guidance.\nsource: Yahoo\npublished: May 16 2024 20:08\nLocation: US, Wall Street\nDate: September, Thursday\nOrganization: Atlanta Fed, Cleveland Fed, New York Fed, Fed, Reddit, Take-Two Interactive, DXC Technology, OpenAI, Federal Reserve\nTitle: President\nPerson: Loretta Mester, Raphael Bostic, John Williams\nclassification: Business\nsentiment: 0\n</doc>\n"

## Chaining

여기서는 agent의 일부로 사용하는 방법을 보여줍니다. OpenAI Functions Agent를 사용하므로 필요한 종속성을 설정하고 설치해야 합니다. 또한 [LangSmith Hub](https://smith.langchain.com/hub)를 사용하여 프롬프트를 가져오므로 이를 설치해야 합니다.

```bash
pip install -U langchain-openai langchainhub
```

```python
import getpass
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = getpass.getpass()
```

```python
from langchain_classic import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_openai_functions_agent
from langchain_community.tools.asknews import AskNewsSearch
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/openai-functions-agent")
llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)
asknews_tool = AskNewsSearch()
tools = [asknews_tool]
agent = create_openai_functions_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools)
agent_executor.invoke({"input": "How is the tech sector being affected by fed policy?"})
```
