이 노트북은 agent와 함께 `arxiv` tool을 사용하는 방법을 다룹니다.

먼저, `arxiv` python package를 설치해야 합니다.

```python
pip install -qU  langchain-community arxiv
```

```python
from langchain_classic import hub
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, create_agent, load_tools
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0.0)
tools = load_tools(
    ["arxiv"],
)
prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")

agent = create_agent(llm, tools, prompt)
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=True)
```

```python
agent_executor.invoke(
    {
        "input": "What's the paper 1605.08386 about?",
    }
)
```

```output

Title: Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases
Authors: Caprice Stanley, Tobias Windisch
Summary: Graphs on lattice points are studied whose edges come from a finite set of
allowed moves of arbitrary length. We show that the diameter of these graphs on
fibers of a fixed integer matrix can be bounded from above by a constant. We
then study the mixing behaviour of heat-bath random walks on these graphs. We
also state explicit conditions on the set of moves so that the heat-bath random
walk, a generalization of the Glauber dynamics, is an expander in fixed
dimension.The paper "1605.08386" is titled "Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases" and is authored by Caprice Stanley and Tobias Windisch. It was published on May 26, 2016. The paper discusses the study of graphs on lattice points with edges coming from a finite set of allowed moves. It explores the diameter of these graphs and the mixing behavior of heat-bath random walks on them. The paper also discusses conditions for the heat-bath random walk to be an expander in fixed dimension.
Final Answer: The paper "1605.08386" is about heat-bath random walks with Markov bases.

## ArXiv API Wrapper

이 tool은 `API Wrapper`를 사용합니다. 아래에서 제공하는 몇 가지 기능을 살펴봅니다.

```python
from langchain_community.utilities import ArxivAPIWrapper
```

ArxivAPIWrapper를 사용하여 과학 논문에 대한 정보를 얻을 수 있습니다. query text는 300자로 제한됩니다.

ArxivAPIWrapper는 다음 논문 필드를 반환합니다:

- Publishing date
- Title
- Authors
- Summary

다음 query는 arxiv ID "1605.08386"을 가진 논문 하나에 대한 정보를 반환합니다.

```python
arxiv = ArxivAPIWrapper()
docs = arxiv.run("1605.08386")
docs
```

```output

'Published: 2017-10-10\nTitle: On Mixing Behavior of a Family of Random Walks Determined by a Linear Recurrence\nAuthors: Caprice Stanley, Seth Sullivant\nSummary: We study random walks on the integers mod $G_n$ that are determined by an\ninteger sequence $\\{ G_n \\}_{n \\geq 1}$ generated by a linear recurrence\nrelation. Fourier analysis provides explicit formulas to compute the\neigenvalues of the transition matrices and we use this to bound the mixing time\nof the random walks.\n\nPublished: 2016-05-26\nTitle: Heat-bath random walks with Markov bases\nAuthors: Caprice Stanley, Tobias Windisch\nSummary: Graphs on lattice points are studied whose edges come from a finite set of\nallowed moves of arbitrary length.

An\nagreement of calculated fluxes with data on charged particles from the AMS and\nCAPRICE detectors is demonstrated. Predictions on neutrino fluxes at different\nexperimental sites are compared with results from other calculations.'
