[OpaquePrompts](https://opaqueprompts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)는 사용자 프라이버시를 침해하지 않으면서 언어 모델의 강력한 기능을 활용할 수 있도록 하는 서비스입니다. 구성 가능성과 기존 애플리케이션 및 서비스로의 통합 용이성을 위해 설계된 OpaquePrompts는 간단한 Python 라이브러리와 LangChain을 통해 사용할 수 있습니다. 더 중요한 것은 OpaquePrompts가 [confidential computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidential_computing)의 강력한 기능을 활용하여 OpaquePrompts 서비스 자체도 보호하고 있는 데이터에 접근할 수 없도록 보장한다는 점입니다.

이 노트북은 LangChain을 사용하여 `OpaquePrompts`와 상호작용하는 방법을 다룹니다.

```python
# install the opaqueprompts and langchain packages
pip install -qU  opaqueprompts langchain
```

OpaquePrompts API에 접근하려면 API key가 필요하며, [OpaquePrompts 웹사이트](https://opaqueprompts.opaque.co/)에서 계정을 생성하여 얻을 수 있습니다. 계정을 생성한 후 [API Keys 페이지](https:opaqueprompts.opaque.co/api-keys)에서 API key를 찾을 수 있습니다.

```python
import os

# Set API keys

os.environ["OPAQUEPROMPTS_API_KEY"] = "<OPAQUEPROMPTS_API_KEY>"
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "<OPENAI_API_KEY>"
```

# OpaquePrompts LLM Wrapper 사용하기

애플리케이션에 OpaquePrompts를 적용하는 것은 `llm=OpenAI()`를 `llm=OpaquePrompts(base_llm=OpenAI())`로 교체하여 OpaquePrompts class로 LLM을 감싸는 것만큼 간단할 수 있습니다.

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.globals import set_debug, set_verbose
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory
from langchain_community.llms import OpaquePrompts
from langchain_core.callbacks import StdOutCallbackHandler
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import OpenAI

set_debug(True)
set_verbose(True)

prompt_template = """
As an AI assistant, you will answer questions according to given context.

Sensitive personal information in the question is masked for privacy.
For instance, if the original text says "Giana is good," it will be changed
to "PERSON_998 is good."

Here's how to handle these changes:
* Consider these masked phrases just as placeholders, but still refer to
them in a relevant way when answering.
* It's possible that different masked terms might mean the same thing.
Stick with the given term and don't modify it.
* All masked terms follow the "TYPE_ID" pattern.
* Please don't invent new masked terms. For instance, if you see "PERSON_998,"
don't come up with "PERSON_997" or "PERSON_999" unless they're already in the question.

# LangChain expression에서 OpaquePrompts 사용하기

단순 교체 방식이 필요한 유연성을 제공하지 못하는 경우 LangChain expression과 함께 사용할 수 있는 함수들도 있습니다.

```python
import langchain_community.utilities.opaqueprompts as op
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

prompt = (PromptTemplate.from_template(prompt_template),)
llm = OpenAI()
pg_chain = (
    op.sanitize
    | RunnablePassthrough.assign(
        response=(lambda x: x["sanitized_input"]) | prompt | llm | StrOutputParser(),
    )
    | (lambda x: op.desanitize(x["response"], x["secure_context"]))
)

pg_chain.invoke(
    {
        "question": "Write a text message to remind John to do password reset for his website through his email to stay secure.",
        "history": "",
    }
)
```
