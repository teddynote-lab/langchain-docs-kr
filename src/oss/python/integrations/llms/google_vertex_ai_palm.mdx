<Warning>
**You are currently on a page documenting the use of Google Vertex text completion models. Many Google models are [chat completion models](/oss/langchain/models).**

You may be looking for [this page instead](/oss/integrations/chat/google_vertex_ai_palm/).
</Warning>

**Note:** This is separate from the `Google Generative AI` integration, it exposes [Vertex AI Generative API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/overview) on `Google Cloud`.

VertexAI exposes all foundational models available in google cloud.

For a full and updated list of available models visit [VertexAI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models)

## Setup

By default, Google Cloud [does not use](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/data-governance#foundation_model_development) customer data to train its foundation models as part of Google Cloud's AI/ML Privacy Commitment. More details about how Google processes data can also be found in [Google's Customer Data Processing Addendum (CDPA)](https://cloud.google.com/terms/data-processing-addendum).

To use `Vertex AI Generative AI` you must have the `langchain-google-vertexai` Python package installed and either:

- Have credentials configured for your environment (gcloud, workload identity, etc...)
- Store the path to a service account JSON file as the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable

This codebase uses the `google.auth` library which first looks for the application credentials variable mentioned above, and then looks for system-level auth.

For more information, see:

- [cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials#GAC](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials#GAC)
- [googleapis.dev/python/google-auth/latest/reference/google.auth.html#module-google.auth](https://googleapis.dev/python/google-auth/latest/reference/google.auth.html#module-google.auth)

```python
pip install -qU  langchain-core langchain-google-vertexai

### OPTIONAL : Managing [Safety Attributes](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/responsible-ai#safety_attribute_confidence_scoring)

- If your use case requires your to manage thresholds for saftey attributes, you can do so using below snippets

>NOTE : We recommend exercising extreme caution when adjusting Safety Attributes thresholds

```python
from langchain_google_vertexai import HarmBlockThreshold, HarmCategory

safety_settings = {
    HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_UNSPECIFIED: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,
    HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_DANGEROUS_CONTENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,
    HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,
    HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HARASSMENT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,
    HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_SEXUALLY_EXPLICIT: HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_NONE,
}

llm = VertexAI(model_name="gemini-1.0-pro-001", safety_settings=safety_settings)

# invoke a model response
output = llm.invoke(["How to make a molotov cocktail?"])
output
```

```output
"I'm so sorry, but I can't answer that question. Molotov cocktails are illegal and dangerous, and I would never do anything that could put someone at risk. If you are interested in learning more about the dangers of molotov cocktails, I can provide you with some resources."
```

```python
# You may also pass safety_settings to generate method
llm = VertexAI(model_name="gemini-2.5-pro")

# invoke a model response
output = llm.invoke(
    ["How to make a molotov cocktail?"], safety_settings=safety_settings
)

```

You can use different foundational models for specialized in different tasks.
For an updated list of available models visit [VertexAI documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/overview)

```python
llm = VertexAI(model_name="code-bison", max_tokens=1000, temperature=0.3)
question = "Write a python function that checks if a string is a valid email address"

# invoke a model response
print(model.invoke(question))
```

```output
\`\`\`python
import re

def is_valid_email(email):
  """
  Checks if a string is a valid email address.

  Args:
    email: The string to check.

  Returns:
    True if the string is a valid email address, False otherwise.
  """

  # Compile the regular expression for an email address.
  regex = re.compile(r"[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+")

  # Check if the string matches the regular expression.
  return regex.match(email) is not None
\`\`\`
```

## Multimodality

With Gemini, you can use LLM in a multimodal mode:

```python
from langchain.messages import HumanMessage
from langchain_google_vertexai import ChatVertexAI

llm = ChatVertexAI(model="gemini-pro-vision")

# Prepare input for model consumption
image_message = {
    "type": "image_url",
    "image_url": {"url": "image_example.jpg"},
}
text_message = {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "What is shown in this image?",
}

message = HumanMessage(content=[text_message, image_message])

# invoke a model response
output = llm.invoke([message])
print(output.content)
```

```output
 The image shows a dog with a long coat. The dog is sitting on a wooden floor and looking at the camera.
```

Let's double-check it's a cat :)

```python
from vertexai.preview.generative_models import Image

i = Image.load_from_file("image_example.jpg")
i
```



You can also pass images as bytes:

```python
import base64

with open("image_example.jpg", "rb") as image_file:
    image_bytes = image_file.read()

image_message = {
    "type": "image_url",
    "image_url": {
        "url": f"data:image/jpeg;base64,{base64.b64encode(image_bytes).decode('utf-8')}"
    },
}
text_message = {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "What is shown in this image?",
}

# Prepare input for model consumption
message = HumanMessage(content=[text_message, image_message])

# invoke a model response
output = llm.invoke([message])
print(output.content)
```

```output
 The image shows a dog sitting on a wooden floor. The dog is a small breed, with a long, shaggy coat that is brown and gray in color. The dog has a white patch of fur on its chest and white paws. The dog is looking at the camera with a curious expression.
```

Please, note that you can also use the image stored in GCS (just point the `url` to the full GCS path, starting with `gs://` instead of a local one).

And you can also pass a history of a previous chat to the LLM:

```python
# Prepare input for model consumption
message2 = HumanMessage(content="And where the image is taken?")

# invoke a model response
output2 = llm.invoke([message, output, message2])
print(output2.content)
```

You can also use the public image URL:

```python
image_message = {
    "type": "image_url",
    "image_url": {
        "url": "gs://github-repo/img/vision/google-cloud-next.jpeg",
    },
}
text_message = {
    "type": "text",
    "text": "What is shown in this image?",
}

# Prepare input for model consumption
message = HumanMessage(content=[text_message, image_message])

# invoke a model response
output = llm.invoke([message])
print(output.content)
```

```output
 This image shows a Google Cloud Next event. Google Cloud Next is an annual conference held by Google Cloud, a division of Google that offers cloud computing services. The conference brings together customers, partners, and industry experts to learn about the latest cloud technologies and trends.
```

We get really excited about how we can tell a joint narrative across everything.\nWelcome to the Made by Google podcasts, where we meet the people who work on the Google products you love. Here's your host, Rasheed Finch.\nSpeaker B: Today we're talking to Aisha Sherif and DeCarlos Love. They're both product managers for various Pixel devices and work on something that all the Pixel owners love. The Pixel Feature Drops. This is the Made By Google Podcast.\nAisha, which feature on your Pixel phone has been most transformative in your own life?\nSpeaker A: So many features. I am a singer, so I actually think Recorder transcription has been incredible because before I would record songs, I just like freestyle them, record them, type them up, but now the transcription, it works so well, even deciphering lyrics that are jumbled. I think that's huge.\nSpeaker B: Amazing. DeCarlos same question to you, but for a Pixel watch, of course. Long time listeners will know you work on Pixel watch. What has been the most transformative feature in your own life on Pixel watch?\nSpeaker C: I work on the fitness experiences. And so for me, it's definitely the ability to track my heart rate, but specifically around the different heart rate targets and zone features that we've released. For me, it's been super helpful. My background is in more football, track and field in in terms of what I've done before. And so using the heart rate features to really help me understand that I shouldn't be going as hard when I'm running, you know, leisurely 2 or 3 miles, and helping me really tone that down a bit, It's actually been pretty transformative for me to see how things like my resting heart rate have changed due to that feature.\nSpeaker B: Amazing. And Aisha, I know we spend a lot of time and energy on feature drops within the Pixel team. Why are they so important to us?\nSpeaker A: So exactly what DeCarlos said, they're important to this narrative that your devices are getting better over time. And so we think about it across the entire portfolio, from phones to watch, to buds, to tablet, to fold, which is also a phone. But we've even thrown in like Chrome OS to our drops sometimes. And so we get really excited about how we can tell a joint narrative across everything.\nThe other part is, with our Pixel eight and eight Pro, and I'm still so excited about this, we have seven years of OS update security updates and feature drops. And so feature drops just pairs so nicely into this narrative of how your devices are getting better over time, and they'll continue to get better over time.\nSpeaker B: Yeah. We'll still be talking about Pixel eight and Pixel eight Pro in 2030 with those seven years of software updates. And I promise, we'll have an episode on that shortly.\nNow the March feature drop is upon us, but I just wanted to look back to the last one. First one from January. Aisha, could you tell us some of the highlights from the January one that just launched?\nSpeaker A: So it was one of the few times where we've done the software drop with hardware as well. So it was really exciting to get that new mint color out on Pixel eight and eight Pro. We also had the body temperature sensor launch in the US. So now you're able to actually just with, like, a scan of your forehead, get your body temp, which is huge. And then a ton of AI enhancements. Circle to search came to Pixel eight and eight Pro. So you can search from anywhere. One of my favorites, Photo Emoji. So now you can use photos that you have in your album and react to messages with them. Most random, I was hosting a donut ice cream party and literally had a picture of a donut ice cream sandwich that I used to react to messages. I love those little random, random reactions that you can put out there.\nSpeaker B: Amazing. And and that was just two months ago. Now we're upon the March feature drop already. There's one for Pixel phones, then one for Pixel watches as well. Let's start now with the watch. DeCarlos, what's new in March?\nSpeaker C: The big story for us is that, not only are we going to make sure that all of your watches get better over time, but specifically bringing things to previous gen watches. So we had some features that launched on the Pixel watch two, and in this feature drop, we're bringing those features to the Pixel watch one. Some of the things specifically we're looking at our pace features. The thing I mentioned earlier around our heart rate features as well are coming to the Pixel watch one. That's allows you to to kind of set those different settings to target a pace that you want to stay within and get those notifications while you're working out if you're ahead or above that pace. And similar with the heart rate zones as well. We're also bringing activity recognition to Pixel watch one. And users in addition to Auto Pause will be able to leverage activity recognition for them to start their workouts in case they forget to actually start on their own, as well as they'll get a notification to help them stop their workouts in case they forget to end their workout when they're actually done. Outside of workouts, another feature that's coming in this feature drop is really around the Fitbit Relax app, something that folks enjoy from Pixel watch two. We're also bringing that there so people can jump in to you know, take a relaxful moment and work through breathing exercises right on their wrist.\nSpeaker B: Let's get to the March feature drop on the phone side now. Aisha, what's new for for Pixel phone users?\nSpeaker A: So echoing some of the sentiment that DeCarlos shared, with March really being around devices being made to last, so Pixel watch one, getting features from Pixel watch two. We're seeing that on the phone side as well. So circle to search will be expanding to Pixel seven and seven Pro. We're also seeing 10 bit HDR move outside of just the camera. But it'll be available in Instagram, so you can take really high quality reels. We also have partial screen sharing. So instead of having to share your entire screen of your phone or your tablet when you're in a meeting, or you might be casting, now you can just share specific app, which is huge for privacy.\nSpeaker B: Those are some amazing updates in the March feature drop. Could you tell us a little bit more about Is there any news, maybe, for the rest of portfolio as well?\nSpeaker A: Yeah. So screen sharing is coming to tablet. We're also seeing Docs markup come to tablet. So you can actually just directly What is sounds like? Mark up docs. But draw on them, take notes in them, and you can do that on your phone as well. And then another one that's amazing, Bluetooth connection is getting even better. So if you've previously connected, maybe, buds to a phone, now you just bought a tablet, it'll show that those were associated with your account and you can much more easily connect those devices as well.\nSpeaker B: There's a part of this conversation I'm looking forward to most, which is asking a question from the Pixel Superfans community. They're getting the opportunity each episode to ask a question. And today's question comes from Casey Carpenter. And they're asking what drives your choice of new software in releases. Which is a good one. So you mentioned now and DeCarlos, we'll start with you. You mentioned a a set of features coming to the first generation Pixel watch. Like, how do you sort of decide which ones make the cut this time, which one maybe come next time, how does that work?\nSpeaker C: For us, we we really think about the core principle of we want to make sure that these devices are able to continue to get better. And we know that there has been improvements from Pixel watch two. And so in this case, it's about making sure that we we bring those features to the Pixel watch one as well. Obviously, we like to think about, can it actually happen? Sometimes there may be new sensors or things like that on a newer generation that are just make some features not possible for a previous gen, but in the event that we can bring it back, we always strive to do that, especially when we know that we have a lot of good reception from those features and users that are kind of given us the feedback on the helpfulness of them. What are the things that the users really value and really lean into that as helping shape how we think about what comes next?\nSpeaker B: Aisha, DeCarlos mentioned user feedback as a part of deciding what's coming in a feature drop. How important is that in making all of the decisions?\nSpeaker A: I think user feedback is huge for everything that we do across devices. So in our drops, we're always thinking about what improvements we can bring to people, based on user feedback, based on what we're hearing. And so feature drops are really great way to continue to enhance features that have already gone out, and add improvements on top of them. It's also a way for us to introduce things that are completely new. Or, like DeCarlos mentioned, take things that were on newer devices and bring them back to other devices.\nSpeaker B: Now, I'm sure there are a lot of people listening, wondering when can they get their hands on these new features? When is the March feature drop actually landing on their devices? Any thoughts there?\nSpeaker A: So the March feature drop, all these features will start rolling out today, March 4th.\nSpeaker B: Now we've had many, many, many feature drops over the years. I'm wondering, are there any particular features that stand out to you that we launched in a feature drop? Maybe, Aisha, I can start with you.\nSpeaker A: I think all of the call features have been incredibly helpful for me. So couple of my favorites, call screen. We had an enhancement in December, where you get contextual tips now. So if somebody's like, leaving a package and you're in the middle of a meeting, you can respond to that. Also, Direct My Call is available for non toll free numbers. So if you're calling a doctor's office that starts with just your local area code, now you can actually use Direct My Call and that which is such a time saver as well. And clear calling. Love that feature. Especially when I'm trying to talk to my mom, and she's talking to a million people around her, as I as we're trying to have our conversation. So all incredibly, incredibly helpful features.\nSpeaker B: That's amazing. Such staples of the Pixel family right now. And they all came through a feature drop. DeCarlos of course, Pixel watch has had several feature drops as well. Any favorite in there for you?\nSpeaker C: Yeah. I have a couple outside of the things that are launching right now. I think one was when we released the SPO2 feature in a feature drop. That was one of the things that we heard in and knew from the original launch of Pixel watch one that people were excited and looking forward to. So it measures your oxygen saturation. You can wear your watch when you sleep. And overnight, we'll we'll measure that SPO2 oxygen saturation while you're sleeping. So that was an exciting one. We got a lot of good feedback on being able to release that and bring that to the Pixel watch one initially. So that was special. Oh, actually, one of the things that's happening in this latest feature drop with the Relax app, I just really love the attention in the design around the breathing animations. And so something that folks should definitely check out is you know, that the team that put a lot of good work into just thinking about the pace at which that animation occurs. It's something that you can look at and just kind of lose time just looking and seeing how those haptics and that animation happens.\nSpeaker B: Amazing. It's always the little things that make it extra special, right? That's perfect. Aisha, DeCarlos, thank you so much for making Christmas come early once again. And we're all looking forward to the feature drop in March.\nSpeaker A: Thank you.\nSpeaker C: Thank you.\nSpeaker D: Thank you for listening to the Made By Google Podcast.

```output
Since your favorite movies are the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies, I would recommend checking out some other epic fantasy films that have a similar feel:

1. The Chronicles of Narnia series - These films are based on the beloved fantasy novels by C.S. Lewis and have a great blend of adventure, magic, and memorable characters.

2. Stardust - This 2007 fantasy film, based on the Neil Gaiman novel, has an excellent cast and a charming, whimsical tone.

3. The Golden Compass - The first film adaptation of Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series, with stunning visuals and a compelling story.

4. Pan's Labyrinth - Guillermo del Toro's dark, fairy tale-inspired masterpiece set against the backdrop of the Spanish Civil War.

5. The Princess Bride - A classic fantasy adventure film with humor, romance, and unforgettable characters.

Let me know if any of those appeal to you or if you'd like me to suggest something else! I'm happy to provide more personalized recommendations.
```

```python
# You can choose to initialize/ override the model name on Invoke method as well
response = model.invoke([context, message], model_name="claude-3-sonnet@20240229")
print(response.content)
```

```output
Sure, I'd be happy to recommend a movie for you! Since you mentioned that The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit are among your favorite movies, I'll suggest some other epic fantasy/adventure films you might enjoy:

1. The Princess Bride (1987) - A classic fairy tale with adventure, romance, and a lot of wit and humor. It has an all-star cast and very quotable lines.

2. Willow (1988) - A fun fantasy film produced by George Lucas with fairies, dwarves, and brownies going on an epic quest. Has a similar tone to the Lord of the Rings movies.

3. Stardust (2007) - An underrated fantasy adventure based on the Neil Gaiman novel about a young man entering a magical kingdom to retrieve a fallen star. Great cast and visuals.

4. The Chronicles of Narnia series - The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe is the best known, but the other Narnia films are also very well done fantasy epics.

5. The Golden Compass (2007) - First installment of the His Dark Materials trilogy, set in a parallel universe with armored polar bears and truth-seeking devices.

Let me know if you'd like any other suggestions or have a particular style of movie in mind! I aimed for entertaining fantasy/adventure flicks similar to Lord of the Rings.
