이 노트북은 Manifest와 LangChain을 함께 사용하는 방법을 다룹니다.

`manifest`에 대한 자세한 정보와 이 예제처럼 로컬 huggingface 모델과 함께 사용하는 방법은 [github.com/HazyResearch/manifest](https://github.com/HazyResearch/manifest)를 참조하세요.

[Manifest를 LangChain과 함께 사용하는](https://github.com/HazyResearch/manifest/blob/main/examples/langchain_chatgpt.html) 또 다른 예제입니다.

```python
pip install -qU  manifest-ml
```

```python
from langchain_community.llms.manifest import ManifestWrapper
from manifest import Manifest
```

```python
manifest = Manifest(
    client_name="huggingface", client_connection="http://127.0.0.1:5000"
)
print(manifest.client_pool.get_current_client().get_model_params())
```

```python
llm = ManifestWrapper(
    client=manifest, llm_kwargs={"temperature": 0.001, "max_tokens": 256}
)
```

```python
# Map reduce example
from langchain.chains.mapreduce import MapReduceChain
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain_text_splitters import CharacterTextSplitter

_prompt = """Write a concise summary of the following:


{text}


CONCISE SUMMARY:"""
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(_prompt)

text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter()

mp_chain = MapReduceChain.from_params(llm, prompt, text_splitter)
```

```python
with open("../../how_to/state_of_the_union.txt") as f:
    state_of_the_union = f.read()
mp_chain.run(state_of_the_union)
```

'President Obama delivered his annual State of the Union address on Tuesday night, laying out his priorities for the coming year. Obama said the government will provide free flu vaccines to all Americans, ending the government shutdown and allowing businesses to reopen. The president also said that the government will continue to send vaccines to 112 countries, more than any other nation. "We have lost so much to COVID-19," Trump said. "Time with one another. And worst of all, so much loss of life." He said the CDC is working on a vaccine for kids under 5, and that the government will be ready with plenty of vaccines when they are available. Obama says the new guidelines are a "great step forward" and that the virus is no longer a threat. He says the government is launching a "Test to Treat" initiative that will allow people to get tested at a pharmacy and get antiviral pills on the spot at no cost.
