title: Doctran으로 문서 질의하기
---

vector store 지식 베이스에 사용되는 문서는 일반적으로 서술형 또는 대화형 형식으로 저장됩니다. 그러나 대부분의 사용자 쿼리는 질문 형식입니다. 문서를 벡터화하기 전에 **문서를 Q&A 형식으로 변환**하면 관련 문서를 검색할 가능성을 높이고 관련 없는 문서를 검색할 가능성을 줄일 수 있습니다.

OpenAI의 function calling 기능을 사용하여 문서를 "질의"하는 [Doctran](https://github.com/psychic-api/doctran) 라이브러리를 사용하여 이를 수행할 수 있습니다.

원본 문서와 질의된 문서를 기반으로 한 다양한 쿼리에 대한 벡터 유사도 점수 벤치마크는 [이 노트북](https://github.com/psychic-api/doctran/blob/main/benchmark.ipynb)을 참조하세요.
