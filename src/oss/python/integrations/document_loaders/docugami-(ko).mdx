이 노트북은 `Docugami`에서 문서를 로드하는 방법을 다룹니다. 대체 데이터 로더에 비해 이 시스템을 사용할 때의 장점을 제공합니다.

## Prerequisites

1. 필요한 python 패키지를 설치합니다.
2. 워크스페이스에 대한 access token을 가져와서 `DOCUGAMI_API_KEY` 환경 변수로 설정되어 있는지 확인합니다.
3. 처리된 문서에 대한 docset 및 document ID를 가져옵니다. 자세한 내용은 다음을 참조하세요: [help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api](https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api)

```python
# You need the dgml-utils package to use the DocugamiLoader (run pip install directly without "poetry run" if you are not using poetry)
!poetry run pip install docugami-langchain dgml-utils==0.3.0 --upgrade --quiet
```

## Quick start

1. [Docugami workspace](http://www.docugami.com)를 생성합니다 (무료 체험 가능)
2. 문서(PDF, DOCX 또는 DOC)를 추가하고 Docugami가 이를 수집하여 유사한 문서 세트(예: NDA, 임대 계약서, 서비스 계약서)로 클러스터링하도록 합니다. 시스템에서 지원하는 고정된 문서 유형 세트는 없으며, 생성되는 클러스터는 특정 문서에 따라 달라지고, 나중에 [docset 할당을 변경](https://help.docugami.com/home/working-with-the-doc-sets-view)할 수 있습니다.
3. Developer Playground를 통해 워크스페이스에 대한 access token을 생성합니다. [자세한 지침](https://help.docugami.com/home/docugami-api)
4. [Docugami API](https://api-docs.docugami.com)를 탐색하여 처리된 docset ID 목록 또는 특정 docset에 대한 document ID를 가져옵니다.
6. 아래에 설명된 대로 DocugamiLoader를 사용하여 문서에 대한 풍부한 의미론적 청크를 가져옵니다.
7. 선택적으로 하나 이상의 [reports 또는 abstracts](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports)를 빌드하고 게시합니다. 이를 통해 Docugami는 사용자의 선호도에 따라 더 나은 태그로 의미론적 XML을 개선하며, 이는 metadata로 DocugamiLoader 출력에 추가됩니다. self-querying retriever와 같은 기술을 사용하여 높은 정확도의 Document QA를 수행합니다.

## Advantages vs Other Chunking Techniques

문서에서 검색하기 위해서는 문서의 적절한 청킹이 중요합니다. 공백에 의존하는 간단한 기술과 문자 길이를 기반으로 한 재귀적 청크 분할을 포함하여 많은 청킹 기술이 존재합니다. Docugami는 다른 접근 방식을 제공합니다:

1. **Intelligent Chunking:** Docugami는 모든 문서를 단일 단어나 숫자 값에서 전체 섹션에 이르기까지 다양한 크기의 청크로 구성된 계층적 의미론적 XML 트리로 분해합니다. 이러한 청크는 문서의 의미론적 윤곽을 따르므로 임의의 길이나 단순한 공백 기반 청킹보다 더 의미 있는 표현을 제공합니다.
2. **Semantic Annotations:** 청크는 문서 세트 전체에서 일관된 의미론적 태그로 주석이 달려 있어, 작성 및 형식이 다르더라도 여러 문서에 걸쳐 일관된 계층적 쿼리를 용이하게 합니다. 예를 들어, 임대 계약서 세트에서 Landlord, Tenant 또는 Renewal Date와 같은 주요 조항뿐만 아니라 전대 조항의 문구나 특정 관할권이 Termination Clause 내에 예외 섹션이 있는지와 같은 더 복잡한 정보를 쉽게 식별할 수 있습니다.
3. **Structured Representation:** 또한 XML 트리는 제목, 단락, 목록, 표 및 기타 일반적인 요소를 나타내는 속성을 사용하여 모든 문서의 구조적 윤곽을 나타내며, 스캔된 PDF 또는 DOCX 파일과 같은 모든 지원되는 문서 형식에서 일관되게 수행합니다. 깨끗한 텍스트 추출을 위해 페이지 머리글/바닥글 또는 다중 열 흐름과 같은 장문 문서 특성을 적절하게 처리합니다.
4. **Additional Metadata:** 사용자가 Docugami를 사용하고 있는 경우 청크에는 추가 metadata도 주석으로 달립니다. 이 추가 metadata는 context window 제한 없이 높은 정확도의 Document QA에 사용할 수 있습니다. 아래의 자세한 코드 워크스루를 참조하세요.

```python
import os

from docugami_langchain.document_loaders import DocugamiLoader
```

## Load Documents

DOCUGAMI_API_KEY 환경 변수가 설정되어 있으면 로더에 명시적으로 전달할 필요가 없으며, 그렇지 않으면 `access_token` 매개변수로 전달할 수 있습니다.

```python
DOCUGAMI_API_KEY = os.environ.get("DOCUGAMI_API_KEY")
```

```python
docset_id = "26xpy3aes7xp"
document_ids = ["d7jqdzcj50sj", "cgd1eacfkchw"]

# To load all docs in the given docset ID, just don't provide document_ids
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id=docset_id, document_ids=document_ids)
chunks = loader.load()
len(chunks)
```

```output
120
```

각 @[`Document`]의 `metadata`(실제로는 실제 PDF, DOC 또는 DOCX의 청크)에는 유용한 추가 정보가 포함되어 있습니다:

1. **id and source:** Docugami 내에서 청크가 소싱된 파일(PDF, DOC 또는 DOCX)의 ID 및 이름.
2. **xpath:** 청크에 대한 문서의 XML 표현 내부의 XPath. 문서 XML 내부의 실제 청크에 대한 소스 인용에 유용합니다.
3. **structure:** 청크의 구조적 속성(예: h1, h2, div, table, td 등). 필요한 경우 호출자가 특정 종류의 청크를 필터링하는 데 유용합니다.
4. **tag:** 다양한 생성 및 추출 기술을 사용한 청크의 의미론적 태그. 자세한 내용은 다음을 참조하세요: [github.com/docugami/DFM-benchmarks](https://github.com/docugami/DFM-benchmarks)

`DocugamiLoader` 인스턴스에서 다음 속성을 설정하여 청킹 동작을 제어할 수 있습니다:

1. 최소 및 최대 청크 크기를 설정할 수 있으며, 시스템은 최소한의 잘림으로 이를 준수하려고 시도합니다. `loader.min_text_length` 및 `loader.max_text_length`를 설정하여 이를 제어할 수 있습니다.
2. 기본적으로 청크의 텍스트만 반환됩니다. 그러나 Docugami의 XML knowledge graph에는 청크 내부의 엔티티에 대한 의미론적 태그를 포함한 추가적인 풍부한 정보가 있습니다. 반환된 청크에 추가 xml metadata를 원하면 `loader.include_xml_tags = True`를 설정하세요.
3. 또한 Docugami가 반환하는 청크에 부모 청크를 반환하도록 하려면 `loader.parent_hierarchy_levels`를 설정할 수 있습니다. 자식 청크는 `loader.parent_id_key` 값을 통해 부모 청크를 가리킵니다. 이는 [small-to-big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihSiRrOUwmg) 검색을 위한 MultiVector Retriever와 함께 사용하는 데 유용합니다. 이 노트북의 뒷부분에서 자세한 예제를 참조하세요.

```python
loader.min_text_length = 64
loader.include_xml_tags = True
chunks = loader.load()

for chunk in chunks[:5]:
    print(chunk)
```

## Basic Use: Docugami Loader for Document QA

Docugami Loader를 여러 문서에 대한 Document QA를 위한 표준 로더처럼 사용할 수 있지만, 문서의 자연스러운 윤곽을 따르는 훨씬 더 나은 청크를 사용합니다. 이를 수행하는 방법에 대한 훌륭한 튜토리얼이 많이 있습니다. 예를 들어 [이 튜토리얼](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yPBVii7Ct0)을 참조하세요. 동일한 코드를 사용할 수 있지만 기본 분할 기술로 텍스트 또는 PDF 파일을 직접 로드하는 대신 더 나은 청킹을 위해 `DocugamiLoader`를 사용합니다.

```python
!poetry run pip install -U langchain-openai tiktoken langchain-chroma hnswlib
```

```python
# For this example, we already have a processed docset for a set of lease documents
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id="zo954yqy53wp")
chunks = loader.load()

# strip semantic metadata intentionally, to test how things work without semantic metadata
for chunk in chunks:
    stripped_metadata = chunk.metadata.copy()
    for key in chunk.metadata:
        if key not in ["name", "xpath", "id", "structure"]:
            # remove semantic metadata
            del stripped_metadata[key]
    chunk.metadata = stripped_metadata

print(len(chunks))
```

```output
4674
```

로더에서 반환된 문서는 이미 분할되어 있으므로 text splitter를 사용할 필요가 없습니다. 선택적으로 각 문서의 metadata(예: structure 또는 tag 속성)를 사용하여 원하는 후처리를 수행할 수 있습니다.

일반적인 방법으로 retrieval QA chain을 설정하기 위해 `DocugamiLoader`의 출력을 그대로 사용합니다.

```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA
from langchain_chroma import Chroma
from langchain_openai import OpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings

embedding = OpenAIEmbeddings()
vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=chunks, embedding=embedding)
retriever = vectordb.as_retriever()
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(), chain_type="stuff", retriever=retriever, return_source_documents=True
)
```

```python
# Try out the retriever with an example query
qa_chain("What can tenants do with signage on their properties?")
```

```output
{'query': 'What can tenants do with signage on their properties?',
 'result': ' Tenants can place or attach signage (digital or otherwise) to their property after receiving written permission from the landlord, which permission shall not be unreasonably withheld.

## Using Docugami Knowledge Graph for High Accuracy Document QA

대용량 문서의 한 가지 문제는 질문에 대한 올바른 답변이 문서에서 멀리 떨어진 청크에 의존할 수 있다는 것입니다. 중복이 있더라도 일반적인 청킹 기술은 LLM에 이러한 질문에 답변하기에 충분한 컨텍스트를 제공하는 데 어려움을 겪습니다. 곧 출시될 매우 큰 컨텍스트 LLM을 사용하면 많은 토큰, 심지어 전체 문서를 컨텍스트 내에 넣을 수 있지만, 매우 긴 문서나 많은 문서의 경우 어느 시점에서 여전히 한계에 도달할 것입니다.

예를 들어, LLM이 문서의 다른 부분에서 청크를 가져와야 하는 더 복잡한 질문을 하면 OpenAI의 강력한 LLM조차도 올바르게 답변할 수 없습니다.

```python
chain_response = qa_chain("What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?")
chain_response["result"]  # correct answer should be 13,500 sq ft

언뜻 보면 답변이 합리적으로 보일 수 있지만 올바르지 않습니다. 이 답변의 소스 청크를 주의 깊게 검토하면 문서의 청킹이 Landlord 이름과 임대 가능 면적을 동일한 컨텍스트에 넣지 못했고 따라서 관련 없는 청크를 생성했으므로 답변이 올바르지 않습니다(**13,500 sq ft**이어야 함)

Docugami가 여기서 도움이 될 수 있습니다. 사용자가 [Docugami를 사용](https://help.docugami.com/home/reports)하고 있는 경우 다양한 기술을 사용하여 생성된 추가 metadata로 청크에 주석이 달립니다. 더 기술적인 접근 방식은 나중에 추가될 예정입니다.

구체적으로 Docugami에 출력에 XML 태그와 추가 metadata를 반환하도록 요청해 보겠습니다:

```python
loader = DocugamiLoader(docset_id="zo954yqy53wp")
loader.include_xml_tags = (
    True  # for additional semantics from the Docugami knowledge graph
)
chunks = loader.load()
print(chunks[0].metadata)
```

```output
{'xpath': '/docset:OFFICELEASE-section/dg:chunk', 'id': '47297e277e556f3ce8b570047304560b', 'name': 'Sample Commercial Leases/Shorebucks LLC_AZ.pdf', 'source': 'Sample Commercial Leases/Shorebucks LLC_AZ.pdf', 'structure': 'h1 h1 p', 'tag': 'chunk Lease', 'Lease Date': 'March  29th , 2019', 'Landlord': 'Menlo Group', 'Tenant': 'Shorebucks LLC', 'Premises Address': '1564  E Broadway Rd ,  Tempe ,  Arizona  85282', 'Term of Lease': '96  full calendar months', 'Square Feet': '16,159'}
```

이 추가 metadata를 사용하여 self-querying retriever를 사용하여 쿼리 정확도를 향상시킬 수 있습니다:

```python
!poetry run pip install -U lark --quiet
```

```python
from langchain.chains.query_constructor.schema import AttributeInfo
from langchain.retrievers.self_query.base import SelfQueryRetriever
from langchain_chroma import Chroma

EXCLUDE_KEYS = ["id", "xpath", "structure"]
metadata_field_info = [
    AttributeInfo(
        name=key,
        description=f"The {key} for this chunk",
        type="string",
    )
    for key in chunks[0].metadata
    if key.lower() not in EXCLUDE_KEYS
]

document_content_description = "Contents of this chunk"
llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

vectordb = Chroma.from_documents(documents=chunks, embedding=embedding)
retriever = SelfQueryRetriever.from_llm(
    llm, vectordb, document_content_description, metadata_field_info, verbose=True
)
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    chain_type="stuff",
    retriever=retriever,
    return_source_documents=True,
    verbose=True,
)
```

동일한 질문을 다시 실행해 보겠습니다. 모든 청크에 문서에 대한 주요 정보를 전달하는 metadata key/value 쌍이 있으므로 이 정보가 답변을 생성하는 데 사용된 소스 청크에서 물리적으로 매우 멀리 떨어져 있더라도 올바른 결과를 반환합니다.

```python
qa_chain(
    "What is rentable area for the property owned by DHA Group?"

```

이번에는 답변이 정확합니다. self-querying retriever가 metadata의 landlord 속성에 대한 필터를 생성하여 DHA Group landlord에 대한 문서로 올바르게 필터링했기 때문입니다. 결과 소스 청크는 모두 이 landlord와 관련이 있으며, landlord가 올바른 답변을 포함하는 특정 청크에 직접 언급되지 않았더라도 답변 정확도가 향상됩니다.

# Advanced Topic: Small-to-Big Retrieval with Document Knowledge Graph Hierarchy

문서는 본질적으로 반구조화되어 있으며 DocugamiLoader는 문서의 의미론적 및 구조적 윤곽을 탐색하여 반환하는 청크에 부모 청크 참조를 제공할 수 있습니다. 이는 [small-to-big](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ihSiRrOUwmg) 검색을 위한 MultiVector Retriever와 함께 사용하는 데 유용합니다.

부모 청크 참조를 가져오려면 `loader.parent_hierarchy_levels`를 0이 아닌 값으로 설정할 수 있습니다.
