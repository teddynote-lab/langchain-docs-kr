>[Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org/)는 Wikipedians로 알려진 자원봉사자 커뮤니티가 개방형 협업과 MediaWiki라는 위키 기반 편집 시스템을 통해 작성하고 유지 관리하는 다국어 무료 온라인 백과사전입니다. `Wikipedia`는 역사상 가장 크고 가장 많이 읽히는 참고 자료입니다.

이 노트북은 `wikipedia.org`에서 wiki 페이지를 다운스트림에서 사용하는 Document 형식으로 로드하는 방법을 보여줍니다.

## Installation

먼저 `langchain_community`와 `wikipedia` 패키지를 설치해야 합니다.

```python
pip install -qU langchain_community wikipedia
```

## Parameters

`WikipediaLoader`는 다음과 같은 인자를 가집니다:

- `query`: Wikipedia에서 문서를 찾는 데 사용되는 자유 텍스트
- `lang` (선택사항): default="en". Wikipedia의 특정 언어 부분에서 검색하는 데 사용합니다
- `load_max_docs` (선택사항): default=100. 다운로드할 문서 수를 제한하는 데 사용합니다. 100개의 문서를 모두 다운로드하는 데 시간이 걸리므로 실험에는 작은 숫자를 사용하세요. 현재 최대 300개로 제한되어 있습니다.
- `load_all_available_meta` (선택사항): default=False. 기본적으로 가장 중요한 필드만 다운로드됩니다: `title`과 `summary`. `True`로 설정하면 사용 가능한 모든 필드가 다운로드됩니다.
- `doc_content_chars_max` (선택사항): default=4000. 문서 콘텐츠의 최대 문자 수입니다.

## Example

```python
from langchain_community.document_loaders import WikipediaLoader
```

```python
docs = WikipediaLoader(query="HUNTER X HUNTER", load_max_docs=2).load()
len(docs)
```

```output
2
```

```python
docs[0].metadata  # metadata of the first document
```

```output
