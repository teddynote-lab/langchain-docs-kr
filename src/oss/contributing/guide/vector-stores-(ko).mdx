I'm ready to translate MDX content from English to Korean following all the rules you've specified. However, I don't see any MDX content provided after "MDX Content to translate:". 

Please provide the MDX content you'd like me to translate, and I'll return the translated version following all the rules, including:
- Translating frontmatter text values (title, description, etc.)
- Keeping technical terms and code unchanged
- Translating text inside component attributes
- Preserving all structure and formatting
